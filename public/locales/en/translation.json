			"shortDescription": "«Star Trek» is an American science fiction media franchise about space expeditions, interplanetary conflicts, and interactions between humans and aliens.",
			"longDescription": " Is an American science fiction media franchise that includes several television series and feature films. Most episodes describe the participation of humans and aliens serving in the Starfleet of the United Federation of Planets in space humanitarian and peacekeeping expeditions. The main characters, having altruistic values, solve complex interplanetary situations. Many of the conflicts and political problems of the series are a reflection of modern cultural reality. Star Trek raised issues that were relevant in the 1960s, and the sequels reflected the problems of their own decades. Various issues were raised: war and peace, the meaning of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class struggle, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism and the role of technology. Roddenberry intended the show to bring a progressive political agenda, reflecting the growing youth counterculture, but he was not entirely transparent about these intentions with the publishers. Through Star Trek, he wanted to show humanity what it could achieve by learning from the lessons of the past, particularly by ending violence.",

			"longDescription": "A British science fiction television series by the BBC about an alien time traveler known as the Doctor. When Sydney Newman created the series, he specifically did not want to repeat the \"bug-eyed monster\" cliche of science fiction. However, monsters were popular with audiences and became an integral part of Doctor Who almost from the very beginning. Some adversaries have become iconic, such as the Daleks and Cybermen, as well as another Time Lord, the Master. The Doctor was the main character of the series, an eccentric alien traveler of great intelligence, outwardly looking like a man, but having two hearts. He fights injustice by traveling through time and space in his old time machine called the TARDIS, often accompanied by Earth satellites. The TARDIS looks like a 1960s British police box, but is much larger on the inside than on the outside. Over the course of the series, the Doctor \"regenerated\" several times, with his appearance and demeanor changing - this allowed the producers of the series to replace the leading actor, while emphasizing that the character, despite the change of face, remains the same, identical to all previous incarnations of the Doctor . As of October 24, 2022, the main character of the series is the Fourteenth Doctor.",
